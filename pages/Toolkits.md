We are rooted in impact-focused academic research, not commercial consulting. We want to be as transparent as possible about our evidence, tools, and methods, and to open-source wherever possible. 

Our [Digital Sustainability Game](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1T08KqkOaDPCbWX5MuUuceSEbYffDygYGtyKxsM_txZs/edit) is something that, with a little preparation, you can explore yourselves within your organization, or deliver to external audiences. The game is open source under a permissive CC license, so you can even adapt it to create your own versions.
